# AI-Based-Smart-Traffic-Management-System-with-Emergency-Vehicle-Prioritization


#Problem Statement
Current traffic signal systems operate on fixed time intervals without adapting to real-time traffic conditions. They:

Cause unnecessary delays for road users during low traffic periods.

Fail to prioritize emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks, leading to delayed response times and potential loss of life.

This lack of dynamic control leads to inefficient traffic flow, long wait times, and life-threatening delays for emergency services.

#Proposed AI Solution
We designed an AI-based traffic management system that:

Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to analyze live traffic footage.

Dynamically adjusts green/red light timings based on real-time vehicle density in each lane.

Detects emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire engines) and overrides normal signal sequences to prioritize their lane, even if it’s not their turn.

Integrates IoT devices (ESP32-CAM and radar modules) to monitor proximity and verify the movement of emergency vehicles.

#Technology Stack
Computer Vision: YOLOv8, OpenCV

Hardware: ESP32-CAM, BeagleBone Black

IoT Integration: Distance sensor (Free-Fi meter), radio-wave-based emergency detection

Programming: Python, Embedded C

Data: Real footage from Coimbatore city under various weather and lighting conditions

🏆 Achievements
🥇 First Prize in Hackathon and Project Expo at SNS College of Technology

🥇 Winner of Ideathon (AI & Smart City Track)

✅ Proof of Concept Approved by the Commissioner of Police, Coimbatore

✅ Selected by MSME Innovation Cell for Pilot Testing

📈 Project Timeline & Milestones
Stage	Description
❌ SIH Rejection	Initially submitted to Smart India Hackathon but rejected due to political reasons
✅ Real-World Data	Acquired rear-view footage → trained model → lacked emergency vehicle clarity
✅ Front View Footage	Reached out again → received proper footage from police → retrained YOLO model
✅ IoT Integration	Used 2 ESP32-CAM modules and Free-Fi meters near signals to detect & prioritize emergency vehicles
🚀 Pilot Testing	Currently under real-environment pilot testing in partnership with local authorities

🎯 Impact
This system:

Reduces average waiting time for vehicles during traffic.

Helps ambulances reach hospitals up to 40% faster.

Proves how AI + IoT can modernize public infrastructure for safety and efficiency.
